## Overview

Craftsman is a command line interface that provides a set of commands that will help you when you're developing your [Codeigniter](http://codeigniter.com) application, in addition to make your job easier.

## Features

Built on top of great technology.

* Solid Base: Built with <a href="https://github.com/symfony/console" target="_blank">Symfony Console component</a>.
* Generators: Generate boilerplate code for a rapid application development.
* Modular Migrations: Manage your database scheme's evolution through independent versions.
* Seeders: Easily fill your database with test data after it's created.
* Test environment: Test your application with ease without installing a web server.
* Interactive: Every command also includes a help screen which describes available options.

## Demo

Here's a little demo of the [Console Command](commands/#console) that runs a [DB Migration](commands/#migrations), next runs a [DB Seed](commands/#seeders) and finally use a simple Model to query all the information stored:
