You can start it with:\n\n\nphp craftsman console\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will bootstrap your application and start an interactive console. At this point you can interact with your application code and execute queries using your application\u2019s models. To quit you can use \nCTRL-C\n or by typing \nexit\n.\n\n\n\n\nServe\n\u00b6\n\n\nTypically, you may use a web server such as Apache or Nginx to serve your Codeigniter applications. If you are on PHP 5.4+ and would like to use PHP's built-in development server, you may use the serve command:\n\n\nphp craftsman serve\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default the HTTP-server will listen to port 8000. However if that port is already in use or you wish to serve multiple applications this way, you might want to specify what port to use. Just add the --port argument:\n\n\nphp craftsman serve --port=8080\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrations\n\u00b6\n\n\nMigration schemes are simple files that hold the commands to apply changes to your database. They may create/update tables or fields, but they are not limited to just changing the schema, you could use them to fix bad data in the database or populate new fields.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Connection Required\n\n\nIf you're going to use Migration Commands you should configure your \"application/config/database.php\" settings to access to your database.\n\n\n\n\nFile names\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach Migration may run in numeric order forward or backwards depending on the method taken. Two numbering styles are available:\n\n\n\n\nSequential\n: each migration is enumerated in sequence, starting with 001. Each number must be three digits, and there must not be any gaps in the sequence.\n\n\nTimestamp\n: each migration is enumerated with a timestamp, in \nYYYYMMDDHHIISS\n format (e.g. 20121031100537). This helps to prevent conflicts when working in a team environment.\n\n\n\n\nBy default Craftsman uses the 'Timestamp' style but you can change to 'Sequential' using the \n--sequential\n argument.\n\n\nDisplaying info\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can display the current migration status with the command:\n\n\nphp craftsman migrate:check\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n(in ~/workspace/codeigniter/application/)\n\n----------- ----------- ---------------- ------------------\n Name        Type        Local version    Database version  \n----------- ----------- ---------------- ------------------\n ci_system   timestamp   20161106010705   20161106010705    \n----------- ----------- ---------------- ------------------\n\nMigration directory: migrations/\n\n[OK] Database is up-to-date.    \n\n\n\n\n\nBelow the information table, there is a legend witch indicates the action to take. If a database update is available, the legend displays the following message:\n\n\n! [NOTE] The Database is not up-to-date with the latest changes, run:'migrate:latest' to update them.\n\n\n\n\n\nRunners\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach migration command shows relevant information about the db scheme changes by default. Here's a list of possible options.\n\n\nLatest\n\u00b6\n\n\nAllows you to migrate the latest version, the migration class will use the very newest migration found in the \nFilesystem\n.\n\n\nphp craftsman migrate:latest\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion\n\u00b6\n\n\nAllows you to roll back changes or step forwards pro-grammatically to specific versions.\n\n\nphp craftsman migrate:version <number>\n\n\n\n\n\nRolling-back\n\u00b6\n\n\nAllows you to quickly roll back and forth through the history of the migration schema, so as to work with desired version. Here's a list of possible options.\n\n\nPrevious\n\u00b6\n\n\nphp craftsman migrate:rollback\n\n\n\n\n\nReset\n\u00b6\n\n\nRollback all migrations.\n\n\nphp craftsman migrate:reset\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresh\n\u00b6\n\n\nRollback all migrations and run them all again.\n\n\nphp craftsman migrate:refresh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeders\n\u00b6\n\n\nCraftsman comes with a simple method of seeding your database. Seeders may have any name you wish, but probably should follow the \nCodeIgniter Style Guide\n.\n\n\nA seeder class only contains the \nrun()\n method by default, this method is called when the \ndb:seed\n command is executed. Within the run method, you may insert data into your database however you wish. Here's an example:\n\n\n<?php\n \nif\n \n(\n \n!\n \ndefined\n(\n'BASEPATH'\n))\n \nexit\n(\n'No direct script access allowed'\n);\n\n\n\nuse\n \nCraftsman\\Database\\Seeder\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nFoo\n \nextends\n \nSeeder\n\n\n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \n$table\n \n=\n \n'<table_name>'\n;\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nrun\n()\n\n  \n{\n   \n    \n$this\n->\ndb\n->\ninsert_batch\n(\n$this\n->\ntable\n,\n \n[\n\n      \n// insert your data here...\n\n    \n]);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n/* End of file Foo.php */\n\n\n/* Location: /path/to/application/seeders/Foo.php */\n\n\n?>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne you have written your seeder class, you may use the command:\n\n\nphp craftsman db:seed <name>\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the \nQuery Builder Class\n to manually insert data.\n\n\nGenerators\n\u00b6\n\n\nCraftsman provides a variety of generators to speed up your development process.\n\n\nController\n\u00b6\n\n\nGenerate a controller with the command:\n\n\nphp craftsman generate:controller <name>\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n<?php\n \nif\n \n(\n \n!\n \ndefined\n(\n'BASEPATH'\n))\n \nexit\n(\n'No direct script access allowed'\n);\n\n\n\nclass\n \nFoo\n \nextends\n \nCI_Controller\n\n\n{\n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Display a listing of the resource.\n\n\n     * GET /foo\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nindex\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Display the specified resource.\n\n\n     * GET /foo/read/{id}\n\n\n     *\n\n\n     * @param  int  $id\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nread\n(\n$id\n)\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n   \n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Show the form for creating a new resource.\n\n\n     * GET /foo/create\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \ncreate\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Store a newly created resource in storage.\n\n\n     * POST /foo/store\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nstore\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Show the form for editing the specified resource.\n\n\n     * GET /foo/edit/{id}\n\n\n     *\n\n\n     * @param  int  $id\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nedit\n(\n$id\n)\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n   \n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Update the specified resource in storage.\n\n\n     * PUT /foo/update/{id}\n\n\n     *\n\n\n     * @param  int  $id\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nupdate\n(\n$id\n)\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n/**\n\n\n     * Remove the specified resource from storage.\n\n\n     * DELETE /foo/delete/{id}\n\n\n     *\n\n\n     * @param  int  $id\n\n\n     */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \ndelete\n(\n$id\n)\n\n    \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n/* End of file Foo.php */\n\n\n/* Location: /path/to/application/controllers/Foo.php */\n  \n\n?>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\u00b6\n\n\nGenerate a model with the command:\n\n\nphp craftsman generate:model <name>\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\n<?php\n \nif\n \n(\n!\n \ndefined\n(\n'BASEPATH'\n))\n \nexit\n(\n'No direct script access allowed'\n);\n\n\n\nclass\n \nFoo_model\n \nextends\n \nCI_Model\n\n\n{\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \n__construct\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nparent\n::\n__construct\n();\n\n        \n$this\n->\nload\n->\ndatabase\n();\n    \n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n/* End of file Foo_model.php */\n\n\n/* Location: /path/to/application/models/Foo_model.php */\n\n\n?>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration\n\u00b6\n\n\nGenerate a migration with the command:\n\n\nphp craftsman generate:migration <name>\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of which style you choose to use, the generator command will prefix your files with the migration number.
